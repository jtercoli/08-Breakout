# 08 - Breakout (Jadan Ercoli)

In this project, we put together everything we've learned up to this point (scripts, sprites, scenes, etc..) The objective of the game is to keep the monster suspended in the air long enough to break every block. Once the monster hits the paddle, it will launch back up, but if it falls below it you will lose a life and the counter will go down by 1.
